# Radon for Fabric

An alternative world storage format that tries to be more performant and durable than vanilla's own. This is hardly more
than a day's worth of work.

Do not use this on existing worlds. In fact, don't use it on any world -- Radon is still very experimental
and unstable and exists as a proof of concept for the time being. It remains to be seen if any of this is a good idea.
